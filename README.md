# FNSPID: A Comprehensive Financial News Dataset in Time Series
FNSPID (Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset), is a comprehensive financial dataset designed to enhance stock market predictions by combining quantitative and qualitative data. It contains 29.7 million stock prices and 15.7 million financial news records for 4,775 S&P500 companies from 1999 to 2023, gathered from four stock market news websites. This dataset stands out for its scale, diversity, and unique incorporation of sentiment information from financial news. Research using FNSPID has shown that its extensive size and quality can significantly improve the accuracy of market predictions. Furthermore, integrating sentiment scores into analyses modestly boosts the performance of transformer-based models. FNSPID also introduces a reproducible method for dataset updates, offering valuable resources for financial research, including complete work, code, documentation, and examples available online. This dataset presents new opportunities for advancing predictive modeling and analysis in the financial research community.


### Dataset location
Due to the large volume of the dataset, the dataset is available at the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Zihan1004/FNSPID/).

### What can this repo do? 
The FNSPID repository offers the FNSPID dataset, experimental results, and a news content scraper tool. It provides comprehensive financial data combining stock prices and news records for S&P500 companies, demonstrates the dataset's impact on prediction accuracy, and includes a tool for updating the dataset with new financial news. 

In this GitHub repo, we did three main tasks：
## 1. Data scraper. 
In folder `data_scraper`, we provided tools to collect news data from Nasdaq.
## 2. Data processor.
In folder `data_processor`, we explained how we integrate our data into workable data.
## 3. Dataset experiments.
In folder `dataset_test`, we provided ways using DL models to test the dataset.


### For details of how to use them, you can find instructions `data_scraper.md`, `data_processor.md`, and `dataset_test.md` in these folders

## Weighted Sentiment CNN Experiment Summary (2026-02)
This section summarizes the local experiment documented in `dataset_test/CNN-for-Time-Series-Prediction/experiment_summary.md`.

### Goal
Compare:
- Baseline sentiment feature (`Scaled_sentiment` as-is)
- Weighted sentiment feature using news availability and volume spike

Weighted feature design:
```python
sent_center = (Sentiment_gpt - 3) / 2  # 1~5 -> -1~1
vol_z = zscore(Volume, rolling window=N)
intensity = News_flag * (1 + k * vol_z)
intensity = clip(intensity, lower=0)
Scaled_sentiment = sent_center * intensity
```

### Setup
- Model: `dataset_test/CNN-for-Time-Series-Prediction`
- Split: `train_test_split = 0.85`
- Sequence length: 50
- Prediction length: 3
- Tested weighted datasets:
  - `data_wN10_k0p1`, `data_wN10_k0p3`, `data_wN10_k0p6`
  - `data_wN20_k0p1`, `data_wN20_k0p3`, `data_wN20_k0p6`
- Not yet tested: `data_wN60_*`

### Baseline results (sentiment, original data)
- AMD: MAE 0.097505, MSE 0.014424, R2 0.513303
- GOOG: MAE 0.052328, MSE 0.003694, R2 0.194527
- KO: MAE 0.037197, MSE 0.002010, R2 0.547467
- TSM: MAE 0.088045, MSE 0.011136, R2 0.516412
- WMT: MAE 0.024453, MSE 0.000930, R2 0.351031

### Key observations from weighted runs
- TSM and GOOG improved in most weighted configurations.
- KO showed mixed behavior (small improvements at low k, degradation at higher k in several settings).
- AMD mostly degraded across weighted settings.
- WMT degraded in all tested weighted settings (largest drop at k=0.6).

### Best directional improvements observed
- TSM: best around `wN20, k=0.6` (dMAE -0.021497, dMSE -0.003821, dR2 +0.165917)
- GOOG: best around `wN10, k=0.6` (dMAE -0.009605, dMSE -0.000932, dR2 +0.203152)

## RNN/LSTM/GRU Experiment: Sequential Sentiment Decay (2026-02).

### Goal
This experiment investigates the temporal persistence of news sentiment.
Unlike CNNs that focus on local feature extraction, we hypothesize that sentiment impact decays exponentially over time and influences subsequent stock prices through sequential memory.


### 📊 Experiment A: Model Performance Comparison (vs. Base CNN)
In this phase, we compared the best-performing configurations of each sequential model against the Baseline CNN to evaluate the effectiveness of capturing "sentiment residue."

#### Key results ($R^2$ inprovement)
| Stock | CNN (Weighted) | RNN | LSTM | GRU |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **GOOG** | +0.2064 | **+0.5863** | +0.5844 | +0.4931 |
| **TSM** | +0.1659 | +0.4040 | **+0.4173** | +0.4105 |
| **AMD** | -0.0103 | +0.3455 | **+0.3694** | +0.3618 |
| **WMT** | -0.2865 | **+0.4503** | +0.4175 | +0.4472 |
| **KO** | +0.0591 | +0.3630 | +0.3782 | **+0.3829** |

#### 💡**Findings**
- Sequential Superiority: Every sequential model (RNN/LSTM/GRU) significantly outperformed the CNN across all tickers
- Recovery of Poor Performers: Stocks like WMT and AMD, which showed degradation in the weighted CNN experiment, achieved massive $R^2$ gains (up to +0.45) when processed through sequential layers


### 📊 Experiment B: Parametric Sensitivity Analysis ($N$ and $k$)

#### 💡**Findings**
| Stock | Best Model | Best Params | $R^2$ (Peak) | Observations |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **GOOG** | **RNN** | $N=10, k=0.3$ | **0.7808** | RNN achieved the highest peak, showing a massive jump from CNN's baseline. |
| **TSM** | **LSTM** | $N=10, k=0.3$ | **0.9337** | Highly stable; all sequential models achieved $R^2 > 0.83$. |
| **AMD** | **LSTM** | $N=20, k=0.1$ | **0.8827** | Significant jump from CNN (0.5) to sequential models (0.8+). |
| **WMT** | **RNN** | $N=20, k=0.3$ | **0.8013** | Successfully normalized predictions at $N=20$ where CNN failed (negative $R^2$). |
| **KO** | **GRU** | $N=10, k=0.3$ | **0.9304** | Gated models (LSTM/GRU) were very stable, while RNN showed instability at $N=10, k=0.1$. |

Each stock showed unique sensitivity to the "Sentiment Decay" feature depending on its market volatility and news persistence.

* **Tech Sector (GOOG, TSM, AMD): High Receptivity to Sequential Memory**
    * **Observation**: These stocks showed the most dramatic $R^2$ improvements (up to +0.58 for GOOG) when moving from CNN to sequential models.
    * **Analysis**: High-tech stocks are highly sensitive to continuous news flows (earnings, tech breakthroughs). LSTM/RNN effectively captured the "persistence" of these news cycles where CNN's static window failed.

* **Consumer Goods & Value Stocks (WMT, KO): Noise Filtering & Gating Importance**
    * **Observation**: **WMT** was a "failure case" for CNN (negative $R^2$) but was successfully "rescued" by RNN/GRU ($R^2$ 0.80+).
    * **Analysis**: For stable stocks like Walmart and Coca-Cola, news often acts as temporary noise. The **Gating Mechanism** of LSTM/GRU and the **Time-Decay** feature acted as a low-pass filter, smoothing out volatility and recovering the underlying price trend.

* **Model Specifics: The Stability of Gated Units**
    * **RNN**: While capable of high peaks (GOOG, WMT), it showed catastrophic instability in certain conditions (KO at $N=10, k=0.1$), likely due to the vanishing gradient problem in specific noise environments.
    * **LSTM/GRU**: Proved to be the most reliable "All-Rounders." Specifically, **LSTM** consistently maintained $R^2 > 0.85$ across almost all tested hyperparameters, making it the most robust choice for sentiment-integrated trading models.
